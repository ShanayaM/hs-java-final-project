Repository for the project for Harbour.Space Java class.

#### Team Members:
* Parshad Barot
* Shanaya Mehta

#### Project Description:
Our objective for this project is to create a java project which goes through the music survey database of students and to visualize the information represnted in the survey. Our project would also be able to sort the songs in the survey based on their title, artist, genre, and release year. Our code would also sort the students based on their major, hobbies, and region. Our goal is to visualise these statstics using a GUI window with different sorting buttons. We are planning to display the data found in the music survey using a glyph and bar plots.
